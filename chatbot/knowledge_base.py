        "It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the element is found. "

        "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. "
        "It divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the results."

    "quick sort": (
        "Quick Sort is a fast divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. "
        "It picks a pivot, partitions the array, and sorts each side recursively."

        "Big-O describes how runtime scales with input size, e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)."
